Simple achievement of a paper classifier

These are very basic and simple scripts of paper classifier, which was applied on 100 pieces of paper and achieved more than 40% test accurancy.

How to run this code:

First run project.py to get word-vectors of each paper (It is proved that use only the abstract of the paper can get better results).

Then run overall.py to cluster the feature vectors by k-means.

Acknowledgement:
	1. The dataset is missing, you can simply test this code by using your own dataset in .txt format.
	2. You may need to change the default path in the scripts.
